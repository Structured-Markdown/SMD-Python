  # Hello, everyone!
  Welcome to my templating engine thingy.
  This is essentially **heirarchal markdown**.
  I'm planning to call ~~Formatted~~ Structured Markdown, or something.

  Anyway, I'm just seeing how effective it is by writing it out like this.
  (Oh, this should be a new paragraph, btw.)

  ## This is a section header
  That's cool.
  [This is a link to nowhere...](/boop)

  Well, that's about all I have to say...
  There are still some kinks to work out, I plan to add the ability to style and stuff.
  (And make the html it returns have proper formatting.)
  Bye!
